# Optimization-Problem-Backtracking

In order to solve a conditionless optimization problem, we can combine the concept of backtracking with two different methods. The first method is called "Steepest Descent Method" and the second is called "Newton Method". In this repo, I attempted to write two small Python scripts, one for each method, in order to solve a specific optimization problem. By changing a few function return values, such as f(x) or the corresponding partial derivatives, we can solve any problem of this kind. Also, by making a better inital estimation of the optimal solution, we achieve more precise results.

This example's function of which we want to find the minimum value of is: 2*x + y^2 + e^(1-x-y)
